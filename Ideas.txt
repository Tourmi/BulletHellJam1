Bullet Hell game jam:

Theme : 10 seconds

Ideas : 
  - Shoot a bullet every ten seconds?
  - Upgrade every ten seconds?
 -- Survive 10 seconds?
 -- "Bombs" every 10 seconds?
 -- 10 seconds to prepare for a boss? (Place walls or protection?)
 -- Plan 10 seconds of movement
  - Pause every 10 seconds?
 -- Change scene every 10 seconds (warioware?)
  - Color/key change every ten seconds? (type of attacks, or ignore one color of bullet)
 -> Every 10 seconds, bullets boomerang back to you
